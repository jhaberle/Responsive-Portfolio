      <p>Hi there, my name is Jake Haberle.  I am 34 years old and I grew up in Parker, Colorado.  I have a beautiful wife, Heather, along with two boys Josh (4),and Dylan (1 1/2).  I love my family more than life itself even though they are making my hair fall out and taking years off of my life.  If I ever have free time I absolutely love going skiing, watching the Broncos, and concocting new whiskey cocktails!

        I currently work at Empower Retirement in Investment Operations as a Valuations Analyst.  I enjoy my role quite a bit, however, many functions within our team are being out-sourced.  I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to develop a new skillset and seek out a new future for myself.</p>
